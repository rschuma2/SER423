/*
 * Here is a simple student class that initializes from Json and deserializes to a Json string.
 * It provides an initializer to create an instance from a json string, and
 * a method to covert an instance back into a json string. The underlying
 * NSJSONSerialization class that's used has been in the api for some time and is the same as
 * used with Objective-C. Accessed in Swift using JSONSerialization. You should use this class
 * as the basis for creating your solution to the lab exercises. Also note that the code assumes
 * for json string format is correct. As with most assignments and examples we'll cover, input
 * validation is ignored, and can be ignored should you be asked to submit code in this course.
