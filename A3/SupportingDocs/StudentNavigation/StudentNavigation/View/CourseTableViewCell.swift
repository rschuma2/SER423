 * Purpose: Navigation Controller based app using Student class as sample model.
 * Students have name, id, and an array of courses they take. Launch page
 * includes a table view in which rows (using table view cell style of subtitle).
 * have student name and id number. From the table view you can add or remove students
 * using the edit of + buttons on the navigation bar.
 * Selecting a student takes you to a view that allows editing the courses taken.
 * Points to read and understand in this example:
 * 1. Building a Navigation Controller (nav bar at top) based app from a single view start
 * 2. Adding classes to an iOS app and associating them with storyboard scenes
 * 3. Adding built-in table view editing through the nav bar. Handling editing events to
 *    properly modify the underlying model and table. (tableView property for UITableView)
 * 4. Adding a button to the nav bar (here its an Add button (+) for adding a new student.
 * 5. Programmatic wire-up of button to a method to handle actions.
 * 6. Using an Alert Controller to query the user (or notify the user). In this case, to
 *    prompt the user to enter student name and id number.
 * 7. Using prepare for segue to pass data to another scene's view controller
 *    And, returning data back to the originating scene using the nav contoller delegate
 *    method: navigationController willShow viewController. (see ViewController class)
 * 8. Manually creating a UITableView as one among other components of a scene's view.
 * 9. DataSources and Delegates (Nav Controller, TableView, and Picker)
 *10. UITableView with single (1) prototype cell. Table View Cell
 *    whose style is custom (and custom identifier for reuse purposes). Dragging
 *    components into the prototype cell, creating IBOutlets for them in the custom
 *    tableviewcell class (CourseTableViewCell), and as an example exposing those
 *    outlets using Swift properties (not necessary).
 *11. Reading a data file from the app bundle and using it to initialize a model object.
