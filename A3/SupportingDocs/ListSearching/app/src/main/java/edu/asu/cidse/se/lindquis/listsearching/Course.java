 * Purpose: This app adds to the SimpleAdapter example (same course topic). The Simple adapter
 * shows how list views can use a SimpleAdapter as its data source. The
 * application is students registered for courses. Here we expand that example
 * to demonstrate functionality of searching. The following steps have been followed:
 *
 * 1. Create an xml resources folder and create the searchable.xml in that folder.
 * 2. When the search is performed and handled in the same event (as here) add the
 *    following to manifest.xml for the searchable activity (MainActivity):
 *    a. android:launchMode="singleTop"
 *    b. the action intent: <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEARCH" />
 *    c. a metadata element in the searchable activity's manifest indicating the
 *       name of the searchable.xml file:
 *         <meta-data android:name="android.app.searchable" android:resource="@xml/searchable"/>
 * 3. Add a menu item (see res/menu/activitiy_main.xml for the action bar search menu item
 * 4. Handle the search menu item selection in the Activity's method
 *    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item)
 *    with a case for action_search. Here, call onSearchRequested to get the search bar to appear
 * 5. Although you can do character by character searching as in iOS, its a bother. The default
 *    in Android is: when the user completes entering the search text and returns/closes the box,
 *    Android notifies the search result activity (same activity here) with a search intent.
 *    We defined the activity to be singleTop to get that intent to be delivered to the onNewIntent
 *    method, rather than creating another MainActivity and delivering it to its onCreate method.
 *    The search string is an extra added to the intent.
 * 6. Android does not support built-in scoped search. Nor does it have at the time of creating
 *    this example, a segmented button. Although there are some availble through open-souce projects.
 *    Instead, in this example to get the same effect as with iOS, we use radio buttons representing
 *    the scope. It may be better to have the scope addressed as part of a dialog before calling
 *    onSearchRequested, although that would also be cumbersome. Got a better solution? Let me know.
