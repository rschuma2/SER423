 * Purpose: This is a single view app which provides the ability to manipulate a list of students
 * and the courses they take. Three model classes: Course, Student, and StudentCollection
 * provide the model. The model is (re)initialized each time the app is started to include all
 * of the students in the resources/raw/students.json file. The app provides the ability to
 * manipulate the collection by providing the ability to add more students (Action bar plus button),
 * to remove a student (by selecting row from the student of students to be removed and clicking
 * the Action Bar garbage can icon). The listview at the bottom of the view displays the current
 * set of courses in which the selected student is enrolled. The add and remove buttons provide
 * for adding courses and removing courses from a student's schedule. The Add button add the Spinner
 * selected course if its not already on the student's schedule. The remove button removes the
 * course in the selected row in the course list.
