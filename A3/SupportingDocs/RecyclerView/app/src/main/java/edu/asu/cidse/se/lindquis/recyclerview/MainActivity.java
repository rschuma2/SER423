 * Purpose: An app to demonstrate Lists in an activity with RecyclerView
 * RecyclerView was introduced by Google to provide for more efficient list
 * scrolling than via ListView, and to provide additional flexibility in
 * lists. Two expensive aspects of scrolling a list are creating (inflating)
 * views for items newly introduced into view, and the method findViewById.
 * Both iOS and Android minimize the number of times you must de-serialize
 * a row's view from xml by re-using views. iOS reduces the overhead in accessing
 * components of a view (the terminal nodes in the view hierarchy) by using
 * IBOutlets (Interface Builder Outlets) and setting them appropriately for each
 * view. Android's ListView recycles views rather than inflating new row views,
 * but historically the hierarchical search to find the controls within a row's
 * view (TextView's and ImageView, for example) had to be accomplished with each
 * (re)population of values into a row's view. Newly (2011) introduced recylclerview
 * removes repeated findViewById searches through use of the ViewHolder (sub)class.
 * The problem with RecyclerView is that there is extensive code to be added by the
 * developer when using this approach. See the referenced course textbook for a deeper
 * explanation and examples.
